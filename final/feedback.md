**Final Score: 52/60**

The grading rubric for the final can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/paulboal/hds5210-2023/blob/main/final/final-instructions.pdf

**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.


**Just a note that one-line functions don't usually make much sense.  For example, "get_nursing_facilities_df" could have just been written without the function**


**(-3) You only did one merge/join operation**

**(-1) Some of your variable names made it hard to follow the work you were doing.  For example `result_df` and `df_groupby` aren't very descriptive names**

**You did some fancy graphics as part of the project, but they weren't really necessary. In fact, they were something of a distraction for me.**

**(-2) Because you had some much going on with plots and correlation analysis, I had a hard time finding your required field level transformations. I don't see where you did at least 5 meaningful field-level transformations**


**(-2) You had a lot going on in your project but think you also missed some of the basic requirements and made your project more confusing to follow**
