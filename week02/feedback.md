# Week 2 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 9/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* Completed

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* **(-1) Your `my_function()` in 5.6 does not calculate force or kinetic energy. It assumes that one of the inputs you provide is the energy and just returns that.**

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
  * **In your 5.6, we don't usually use all caps for our variable names. That's not something normally done in Python except for a few special cases.**
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
